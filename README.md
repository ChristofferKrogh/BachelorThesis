Implementation of data structures for mergeable dictionaries
The program was written and tested in Xcode on a mac computer. 
There is no user interface for the program. In order to see the results of the different tests, 
you must go to the method called 'printTests' within the 'Testing.cpp' class and uncomment the test that you wish to execute.

Note that the project uses functionality from c++14, so older versions of c++ might not be able to execute the program.
